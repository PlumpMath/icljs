Next Steps
''''''''''''

Congratulations! You’ve made it through the book. You now have the basics that you need to write ClojureScript programs. More important, you have learned some of the functional programming concepts that you can use to tell computers how to do things. Solving problems is the purpose of programming; the language is the vehicle.

Where Do I Go From Here?
-------------------------

The best way to become a better program is to write programs. Period. What programs should you write? Here is `Kurt Vonnegut’s advice on writing <http://kmh-lanl.hansonhub.com/pc-24-66-vonnegut.pdf>`_, and it applies well to programming:

    “Find a subject you care about and which you in your heart feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, and not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style. I am not urging you to write a novel, by the way |---| although 1 would not be sorry if you wrote one, provided you genuinely cared about something. A petition to the mayor about a pothole in front of your house or a love letter to the girl next door will do.”
    
Find something that you think would be interesting to have a computer do, and then **plan**. Sometimes it helps to figure out how you would solve the problem by hand. Another approach is to pretend you are giving instructions over the phone to someone who doesn’t know the problem area, but is very good at following instructions.

As you start writing your programs, you will get to a point where you want to do something or other, but it’s something that is not in this book or something you don’t know how to do yet.  You need...


Further Resources
-------------------

`clojuredocs.org <https://clojuredocs.org/>`_
    This is your go-to site for looking up functions in Clojure and ClojureScript. Most of the functions have copious notes and examples.
    
`ClojureScript Unraveled <https://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/>`_
    This online book covers more of ClojureScript than this book, and in much greater depth. This would be a good “next step” in your learning path.
    
`Clojure for the Brave and True <http://www.braveclojure.com/>`_
    This book is about Clojure (which compiles to code that works with Java), but everything you learn will apply with minor or no changes to ClojureScript.
    
`Études for ClojureScript <http://catcode.com/etudes-for-clojurescript/>`_
    Shameless self-promotion. This is a book of exercises to help you learn ClojureScript. Also available `in book form <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043584.do>`_.
    
`ClojureScript Koans <http://clojurescriptkoans.com/>`_
    A series of short interactive exercises that “walk you along the path of enlightenment to learning ClojureScript.”
    
`Modern ClojureScript <https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs>`_
    “A series of tutorials that guide you in creating and running ClojureScript projects.” Lots of information about interacting with the JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM).

In Conclusion
---------------

Thanks again for reading the book, and enjoy learning and using ClojureScript!
