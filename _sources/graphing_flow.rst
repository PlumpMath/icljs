Graphing Program: Outline
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

As a reminder, the object is to transform this data::

    [[3 9] [2 13] [4 10] [4 9] [4 12] [9 20] [16 21]]
    
into this graph:

.. image:: images/temperature_graph.png
    :alt: Line graph showing max temperature as red line and min temperature as blue line

The program will have to:

* Split the temperatures into two sets of *x*, *y* pairs to be graphed::

    [[[1 3] [2 2] [3 4] [4 4] [5 4] [6 9] [7 16]]
    [[1 9] [2 13] [3 10] [4 9] [5 12] [6 20] [7 21]]]
    
* Draw the axes:

  * Draw the lines
  * Draw the tick marks
  * Draw the labels
    
* Draw a connected line for the minimum teperatures
* Draw dots for the minimum temperatures
* Draw a connected line for the maximum temperatures
* Draw dots for the maximum temperatures
