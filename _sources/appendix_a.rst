Appendix A: Basics of HTML
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Since ClojureScript is designed to work with web pages, you wil need to know the basics of HTML |---| the language of web pages.

This appendix (to be written) gives an extremely abbreviated summary of HTML; you will learn just enough to write pages that can interact with ClojureScript, or, to put it another way, you will know enough to be dangerous.
